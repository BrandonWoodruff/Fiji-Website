          Lovo is a traditional Fijian cooking method that involves burying food in an underground oven. This communal style of cooking is often used for special occasions and gatherings.

          Kokoda is a popular Fijian dish similar to ceviche. It features raw fish (often mahi-mahi or tuna) marinated in lime or lemon juice, coconut cream, chili, and a mix of herbs and spices. The acid in the citrus juice "cooks" the fish, resulting in a refreshing and zesty dish.
